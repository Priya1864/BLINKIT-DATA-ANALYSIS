Tool Used:

Microsoft Excel – used pivot tables, charts, and filters to analyze and visualize the data.


Questions I Answered:

Which type of outlets bring in more sales?

What kind of products do people buy the most?

Which city levels (Tier 1, 2, or 3) perform best?

Do low-fat items sell more than regular ones?

Which product categories are underperforming?

Insights:

Medium and high-size outlets make most of the sales.

Tier 3 cities buy the most, even more than Tier 1 and Tier 2.

People prefer low-fat items – they generate more revenue.

Fruits, snacks, and household goods are top-selling items.

Supermarket Type 1 performs the best among outlet types.

Conclusions:

The company should focus more on Tier 3 cities and medium-sized outlets.

Low-fat and popular categories like snacks should be prioritized.

There’s a chance to improve sales by focusing on low-performing products.

Recommendations:

Open more outlets in high-performing city tiers.

Keep promoting healthy (low-fat) and fast-moving products.

Work on improving or removing items that don’t sell much.
